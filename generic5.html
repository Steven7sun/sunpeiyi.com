										<h1>Fashion Design</h1>
									</header>
									<span>When I opened the photo album, I found that my body movements in the photo were almost arms crossed, which also led to my concept. When communicating with strangers and taking photos, I often feel embarrassed and absent. In order to further understand this kind of body movement and explore whether other people have the same feeling, I have done some second-hand research, which shows that this kind of action is the subconscious self-protection of human beings. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/FD01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In order to directly observe people's physical movements in awkward situations, I walked to a shopping mall and randomly interviewed strangers passing by about their psychological knowledge. In order to minimize the disturbance of psychological cues, the interviewees were unaware that I was videotaping them during the interview. At the end of the interview, I selected and framed excerpts of the video I shot, forming some initial ideas for sleeve ties. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/FD02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>For the fabric research I used metallic loops and defined blocks and did some fabric design with the different depths of blue I used in my first few studies. Based on the photos used in the preliminary research, I selected some blue fabrics. To enhance some of the textures, I also took different textures from the childhood photos and selected blue fabrics with different textures In order to be able to preserve these smells over a long time, I processed them in a way similar to refining essences, and then kept these processed spices in the bottle based on dates. Whenever I unscrew a cap, the smell in the bottle will bring me back to that memory.</p>

									<p>During the 3d experiment I designed many different sleeves in different fabrics and bought and disassembled a striped lining. With these different sleeve sizes I tried out different binding effects.</p>
